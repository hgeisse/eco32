Format of Object and Executable Files
-------------------------------------

0) General

The "a.out" file format is used as the format for assembler output
("object files") as well as for linker output ("executable files").
The difference between these two is the size of certain sections of
the file being zero in case of executable files.

The file consists of a header and up to 5 sections:
  - segment table
  - symbol table
  - relocation table
  - segment data
  - string space
The different sections are not required to appear in this order in
the file; their offsets and sizes can be extracted from the header.


1) Header

The header specifies the file offsets and sizes of the following
sections, but has itself a fixed size and is always present at
file offset 0:

typedef struct {
  unsigned int magic;		/* must be EXEC_MAGIC */
  unsigned int osegs;		/* offset of segment table in file */
  unsigned int nsegs;		/* number of segment table entries */
  unsigned int osyms;		/* offset of symbol table in file */
  unsigned int nsyms;		/* number of symbol table entries */
  unsigned int orels;		/* offset of relocation table in file */
  unsigned int nrels;		/* number of relocation table entries */
  unsigned int odata;		/* offset of segment data in file */
  unsigned int sdata;		/* size of segment data in file */
  unsigned int ostrs;		/* offset of string space in file */
  unsigned int sstrs;		/* size of string space in file */
  unsigned int entry;		/* entry point (if executable) */
} ExecHeader;

The magic number is used to distinguish object and executable
files from other file types. It must have the value EXEC_MAGIC.

The segment table starts at file offset osegs and has nsegs
entries. It describes the segments contained in the object file
(typical segments are ".code", ".data", and ".bss").

The symbol table starts at file offset osyms and has nsyms
entries. It contains information about symbols which are
exported from or imported into this object file. It is mainly
used during the link step and may not be present (nsyms = 0)
if the file is an executable.

The relocation table starts at file offset orels and has nrels
entries. Each entry points to a place in a segment where the
binary data has to be modified during the link step. The table
is empty (nrels = 0) if the file is an executable.

The binary data proper of all segments is contained in the
segment data section of the file. It begins at file offset
odata, and has a size of sdata bytes.

The textual representation of all names (of segments, symbols,
etc.) is contained in the string space which starts at file
offset ostrs, and has a size of sstrs bytes. The strings are
null-terminated and stored without any padding.

The program's starting address is given by the value of "entry".
It only has meaning in executable files.


2) Segment Table

Each entry in the segment table describes a single segment:

typedef struct {
  unsigned int name;		/* offset in string space */
  unsigned int offs;		/* offset in segment data */
  unsigned int addr;		/* virtual start address */
  unsigned int size;		/* size of segment in bytes */
  unsigned int attr;		/* segment attributes */
} SegmentRecord;

#define SEG_ATTR_X	0x01	/* executable */
#define SEG_ATTR_W	0x02	/* writable */
#define SEG_ATTR_P	0x04	/* present in object file */
#define SEG_ATTR_A	0x08	/* allocatable in memory */

The segment's name is given by its offset into the string space.
Its binary data is found at offset offs into the segment data.
The segment's virtual start address is specified by addr, and its
size is given in bytes. This is also the size of the binary data
contained in the file, but only if the "present in object file"
attribute (SEG_ATTR_P) is set. Otherwise there is no binary data
present for this segment. The attributes SEG_ATTR_X and SEG_ATTR_W
specify if the segment is executable and writable, respectively.
If the attribute SEG_ATTR_A is set, the loader must allocate space
in memory for the segment during loading. Typical combinations are:
    .code    APX
    .data    APW
    .bss     AW


3) Symbol Table

For every symbol which is imported into or exported from the current
object file, there is a corresponding symbol table record:

typedef struct {
  unsigned int name;		/* offset in string space */
  int val;			/* the symbol's value */
  int seg;			/* the symbol's segment, -1: absolute */
  unsigned int attr;		/* symbol attributes */
} SymbolRecord;

#define SYM_ATTR_U	0x01	/* undefined */

The symbol's name is given by its offset into the string space.
If the symbol is defined, val holds its value and seg holds the
segment in which the symbol is defined (-1 meaning "the symbol's
value is not relative to a segment but absolute"). The symbol's
attribute is a single bit, which means "symbol undefined" when
set. In this case, val and seg are meaningless.


4) Relocation Table

The relocation table consists of records, each of which points
to a specific location where the contents must be modified when
segments are moved within the virtual address space or when the
value of a symbol becomes known during the link step:

typedef struct {
  unsigned int loc;		/* where to relocate */
  int seg;			/* in which segment */
  int typ;			/* relocation type: one of RELOC_xxx */
  int ref;			/* what is referenced */
				/* if symbol flag = 0: segment number */
				/* if symbol flag = 1: symbol number */
  int add;			/* additive part of value */
} RelocRecord;

#define RELOC_H16	0	/* write 16 bits with high part of value */
#define RELOC_L16	1	/* write 16 bits with low part of value */
#define RELOC_R16	2	/* write 16 bits with value relative to PC */
#define RELOC_R26	3	/* write 26 bits with value relative to PC */
#define RELOC_W32	4	/* write full 32 bit word with value */
#define RELOC_SYM	0x100	/* symbol flag, may be added to any RELOC */

Loc and seg together determine the place where the relocation
must be applied. This is always a word address, i.e., loc is
divisible by 4. Typ specifies what exactly is to be done with
the computed value (e.g., take only the 16 lower bits and write
them into the lower half of the word). Typ may have its symbol
flag set (or cleared), which influences the interpretation of
ref. In case the symbol flag is set, ref is a symbol number
(index into the symbol table), otherwise (symbol flag cleared)
ref is a segment number (index into the segment table). In both
cases, the value which is used in the relocation is computed as
the sum of the symbols's value (or the segment's start address)
and add, the additive part in the relocation record.


5) Object Data

This section contains the binary data of all segments. The data of
each segment is padded with zeros to achieve a segment size which
is a multiple of 4 bytes. All segments are then concatenated.


6) String Space

The string space is used to store the names of all symbols in the
object file. The strings are null-terminated and stored without
any padding.


7) Executing an Executable

It is the task of the loader to prepare execution of a program.

The loader has to execute the following steps:
  - read and inspect file header, check magic number
  - read segment table, process segment records individually
  - ignore the segment if its SEG_ATTR_A is cleared
  - allocate virtual memory (addr and size given in segment record)
  - if SEG_ATTR_P is set, read memory contents from file
  - if SEG_ATTR_P is cleared, set memory contents to zero
  - set up memory protection according to SEG_ATTR_W and SEG_ATTR_X
  - after all segments are loaded, set up a stack
  - begin execution of the program at its entry point.



Format of Static Library Files
------------------------------

0) General

The "ar" file format is used for library files which are statically
linked with other object files in order to get an executable file.

typedef struct {
  unsigned int magic;		/* must be ARCH_MAGIC */
  unsigned int omods;		/* offset of module table in file */
  unsigned int nmods;		/* number of module table entries */
  unsigned int odata;		/* offset of data space in file */
  unsigned int sdata;		/* size of data space in file */
  unsigned int ostrs;		/* offset of string space in file */
  unsigned int sstrs;		/* size of string space in file */
} ArchHeader;

typedef struct {
  unsigned int name;		/* offset of name in string space */
  unsigned int offs;		/* offset of module in data space */
  unsigned int size;		/* size of module in bytes */
  unsigned int fsym;		/* first symbol name in string space */
  unsigned int nsym;		/* number of symbol names */
} ModuleRecord;
